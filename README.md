This is one of the tasks given to us in the internship we are doing with The Sparks Foundation i.e, GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program )

Task 1 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours          they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

Task 2 - To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning From the given ‘Iris’ dataset,we will predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

Taak 3 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm.For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and

         visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
